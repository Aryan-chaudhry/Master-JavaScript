// when javascript automatically convert one datatype to another is known as coercion

let a = 2;
let b = "35";
let c = a+b;
console.log(c); // js convert a in string and then concatenate automatically

// i want to do conversion & coercion both at same time
console.log(Number(c)); // 235 as a number
